## Project Overview

Access to startup funding information in India is often limited by language barriers, fragmented data sources, and lack of explainability in AI-driven tools. Most funding reports, government policies, and investor insights are available only in English and scattered across multiple platforms.

This project presents a **Multilingual Startup Funding Intelligence System** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The system enables founders to ask funding-related questions in Indic languages and receive accurate, source-backed, and explainable answers derived from real funding data, reports, and policy documents.

---

## Problem Statement

- Startup funding information is distributed across multiple unstructured sources
- Existing tools are English-centric and difficult to use for regional founders
- AI chatbots often generate answers without verifiable sources
- Founders spend excessive time searching without actionable clarity

---

## Proposed Solution

The proposed system aggregates funding-related data from trusted sources, processes it into a unified knowledge base, and applies RAG-based AI to generate reliable answers. Multilingual language support ensures inclusivity, while source citations ensure trust and transparency.

---

## Key Features

- Multilingual query and response support for Indic languages
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation for grounded and factual answers
- Source-cited responses from verified documents
- Hybrid search using semantic and keyword-based retrieval
- Funding insights including investors, schemes, stages, and trends
- Hallucination prevention through strict grounding and validation

---

## System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:
1. User Interface for multilingual interaction
2. Language Intelligence layer for detection and translation
3. RAG Orchestration layer for query understanding
4. Retrieval layer with vector search and re-ranking
5. Generation layer for grounded answer creation
6. Knowledge Base with structured and unstructured data sources

## AI Technologies Used

- Generative AI for natural language understanding and response generation
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ensure factual correctness
- Multilingual Natural Language Processing for Indic languages
- Text embeddings and vector search for semantic retrieval
- Re-ranking models to improve result relevance
- Document processing for PDFs, web pages, and datasets
